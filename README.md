# Test Website
Today I explain about how I attend Computer Science Principles class and how I am able to attach a fridge to a website with the use of images and HTML code.
There's also going to be some sort of attempt to add buttons that do literally nothing in the future. If anything, I'll make them work at some point, with the power of me randomly trying out things until the work.
