    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>This is my first test website for my Computer Science Principles class.</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to explain a bit about myself. But I didn't know what exactly to explain about myself. So I just did a bunch of random things instead.</p>
    <p>I made <a href="pudding.html"> pudding</a> this one time, the link detailing all about it.</p>
    <p>I wrote <a href="story.html"> a story</a> at some time as well, about a girl and her robot. It ends pretty quickly so you can assume her fate.</p>
    <p>And I made <a href="alternatingtable.html"> this</a> for some random assignment a while back.</p><br>
    <p>The rest of this website details other things I did that I didn't shove into other websites.</p>
    
    <h2>I talked about fridges exploding.</h2>
    <a href="download.jpeg"><img src="download.jpeg"></a><br>
    <p>An image of a fridge I do not in fact own. I like how the fridge looks, being all fridgelike.</p>
    <p>It will explode at some point. All fridges explode.</p>
    <p><h5>Reasons why the fridge will explode</h5></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Because there is a bomb in it.</li>
      <li>Bombs explode.</li>
      <li>Therefore, the fridge will explode when the bomb explodes.</li>

<h2>I wrote random paragraphs out of nowhere.</h2>
<p>And for some reason, here I am again, typing endlessly into the endless space of absolutely nothing like it's something I do on a daily occurence.</p>
<p>In some way, the entire concept of it is funny. I'm here, constantly correcting any and all spelling mistakes I notice, despite there not really being any value to doing so.</p>
<p>Maybe it's experience though. A lot of people get paid in experience by doing things repeatedly. Not like that affords their rent, but it does get them a better job. Probably. I don't actually know, because I don't have a job yet.</p>
<p>And well, I would be looking for a job by now, but I think I tried doing that last month. Browsed if the local McDonalds was hiring since fast food is a common first option and they were only hiring 16+ year olds. I'm 15, for all things, and they had to do that to me.</p>
<p>Genuinely, what happened to the meaning of that sign posted out of a random McDonalds that said "We Hire 15 Year Olds!"? Was there that much backlash against that that they raise the age limit by a year?</p>
<p>And on a secondary note, what's with child labor laws letting us be paid less for doing the same work a adult would do? Excuse me? That's a completely dumb concept in my opinion. I'd be working to get money to help myself in the future, of all things. And I'd like to be getting a living wage as I do so.</p>
<p>Though, speaking of wages, I think I actually prefer the pay by task sort of system here. Like, complete a task, get paid. The faster you do it, the better. At least, that's just my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do the endless line style of format for this paragraph. The previous paragraph, I used multiple paragraph tags for about each sentence I typed, save for the extremely small ones. So, I'm staring at the clock. Cause the typing thing is in the bottom-right corner of my screen now and that's also where the clock is right now as well. It's 8:58 AM PST at the time I've typed this sentence. I feel as if when you pay attention to the time, time actually passes slower. And that's a good thing, because I'm using that extra time to type out this paragraph. It's so efficient, that I don't even think I spelled that last word correctly. I've got 6 minutes left to type up the rest of this paragraph and the next one, so I'll probably say this is a done paragraph for now. Like, how much have I typed? This formatting thing only shows how much lines there are, it says nothing about like, the collum you're on. Which is why I like notepad, actually, it lets you tell how far you are from the beginning of the line that way. I don't know if the feature is actually still there in the Windows 11 notepad, but it sure is in the 10 version. I haven't updated to the 11 version yet because the comptuer I use at home isn't really that capable of updating from what I understand. That's fine to me anyways, because I don't really like how Windows 11 makes all the tabs curved. I want to see rectangles with angles, not rectangles with curves!</p>
  <p>I think I like the endless line paragraph style now. It lets me type off into infinity, without having to bother for constantly making new lines with the paragraphs. I haven't actually checked out the webpage to see how that looks, but I think it has a sort of text wrap thing that means it doesn't just fly off into the distance and actually wraps around like a normal paragraph would do without line breaks. I've run out of any topics to talk about now anyways, so I'm going to talk about the table that's in my view currently. It's a pretty light-brownish color, and I can see that it has a wood-like pattern on it. If it was actually cut from a piece of wood, that's a pretty wide piece of wood, and I wonder how long it took for that piece of wood to grow to this size just for us to saw it in half like this to make all these tables in this classroom. No, I'm not starting a campain for tree rights if you think that's what I'm doing. That's a stupid idea. Speaking of that sort of topic, I read on the internet that apparently plastic isn't vegan as it's made out of the bones of dead dinosaurs or something. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's a funny thought. I doubt that the vegans would actually stop using plastic, though, though maybe plastic straws. I think they've stopped using plastic straws after seeing how much it hursts the ocean. Actually, I think a lot of people other than vegans are doing that as well. I should stop using plastic as well, as to not make those guy's job harder. There are people working on taking the plastic out of the ocean currently after all, and I don't want to add more so they have to spend more time doing that. I'm not [Insert Name Here].</p>
