    <h1>Hello [Insert Your Name Here As I Do Not Know It]!</h1>
    <h2>This is my first test website for my Computer Science Principles class.</h2><br>
    <p>So far, I've done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding images</li>
      <li>Adding thumbnails and hyperlinks to said images</li>
      <li>Making those images independent from other websites</li>
      <li>Incorporating lists</li>
      <li>Adding tables</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="download.jpeg"><img src="download.jpeg"></a><br>
    <p>An image of a fridge I do not in fact own. I like how the fridge looks, being all fridgelike.</p>
    <p>It will explode at some point. All fridges explode.</p>
    <p><h5>Reasons why the fridge will explode</h5></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Because there is a bomb in it.</li>
      <li>Bombs explode.</li>
      <li>Therefore, the fridge will explode when the bomb explodes.</li>
    </ol>
    <a href="Fire.png"><img src="Fire.png"></a><br>
    <p><i>Oh, look at that. It did explode. Oh well, moving on.</i></p>
    <p>By the way, those pictures are <b>clickable!</b> You can click on them to get larger images of the before and after!</p><br>
    <a href="https://www.google.com"><img src="Google.png"></a><br>
    <p>By the way, if you want to run away from <u>this website</u>, you can click the image above to get sent to <b>google.com</b></p>
  <p>Reasons why you should:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Because, you're at the bottom of this site.</li>
    <li>Google is much better than this site because it functions as a web browser as well.</li>
    <li>There is nothing else to do on this site.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Intro to CSS Paragraphs</h1>
<p>And for some reason, here I am again, typing endlessly into the endless space of absolutely nothing like it's something I do on a daily occurence.</p>
<p>In some way, the entire concept of it is funny. I'm here, constantly correcting any and all spelling mistakes I notice, despite there not really being any value to doing so.</p>
<p>Maybe it's experience though. A lot of people get paid in experience by doing things repeatedly. Not like that affords their rent, but it does get them a better job. Probably. I don't actually know, because I don't have a job yet.</p>
<p>And well, I would be looking for a job by now, but I think I tried doing that last month. Browsed if the local McDonalds was hiring since fast food is a common first option and they were only hiring 16+ year olds. I'm 15, for all things, and they had to do that to me.</p>
<p>Genuinely, what happened to the meaning of that sign posted out of a random McDonalds that said "We Hire 15 Year Olds!"? Was there that much backlash against that that they raise the age limit by a year?</p>
<p>And on a secondary note, what's with child labor laws letting us be paid less for doing the same work a adult would do? Excuse me? That's a completely dumb concept in my opinion. I'd be working to get money to help myself in the future, of all things. And I'd like to be getting a living wage as I do so.</p>
<p>Though, speaking of wages, I think I actually prefer the pay by task sort of system here. Like, complete a task, get paid. The faster you do it, the better. At least, that's just my opinion.</p>
<p>Is this three paragraphs yet? No? Well, I think I probably typed the worth of three small paragraphs here by now. If anything, the rest of the paragraphs is in the space beyond.</p>
