    <h1>A Bit About Kara.</h1>
    <h2>Story 1.</h2>
    <p>She stared at the world with sorrow in her eyes, like the child she was, born to have expected joy and laughter. "Why?", she asked to herself, "was the world this cruel?" Of course, the world never answered her question, as the world itself refuses to give us an answer for why, because it doesn't feel like it needs to give that answer. It was then that, faced with the torment and anguish of the modern civilization, that Kara ran away from her home at the ripe age of 9 years old. Even so, the world outside hers, the wilderness, was just as cruel. She found herself running deeper and deeper into a dark cavern, running away from wolves. At some point, though, she was running from empty air, as not even wolves would chase their prey that far into that cave.</p>
    <p>And that was for good reason.</p>
    <p>Kara couldn't see a thing in the cave she had found herself unwillingly going into. No amount of time would let her eyes adjust to this darkness. So she stumbled around, hitting rock here, hitting stone there. After she was covered in scratches from consistently hitting sharp stones, a light finally showed itself in the darkness. A dark brown, amber light, that lit up the part of the caverns that the mechanical eye it belonged to lay, attached to it's unmoving metalic body. Kara showed no fear, though. She had no idea what the potential dangers of a giant robot 10 times the size of her was. She was just 9 years old, after all. A child, even after realizing the state of the world, still doesn't know that much, and that was evident as she lay by the robot, the warmth of the light slowly drifting her off to sleep.</p>
    <p>The next morning, she awoke, laying in the giant palm of the mechanical giant, the warm amber eye staring straight at her. And a voice erupted from it, as monotonous as a robot's could be.</p>
