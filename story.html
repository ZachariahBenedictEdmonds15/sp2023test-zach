    <h1>A Bit About Kara.</h1>
    <h2>Story 1.</h2>
    <p>She stared at the world with sorrow in her eyes, like the child she was. "Why?", she asked to herself, "was the world this cruel?" Of course, the world never answered her question, as the world itself refuses to give us an answer for why, because it doesn't feel like it needs to give that answer. It was then that, faced with the torment and anguish of the modern civilization, that Kara ran away from her home at the ripe age of 9 years old. Even so, the world outside hers, the wilderness, was just as cruel. She found herself running deeper and deeper into a dark cavern, running away from wolves. At some point, though, she was running from empty air, as not even wolves would chase their prey that far into that cave.</p>
    <p>And that was for good reason.</p>
