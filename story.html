    <h1>A Bit About Kara.</h1>
    <h2>Story 1.</h2>
      <p>She stared at the world with sorrow in her eyes, like the child she was, born to have expected joy and laughter. "Why?", she asked to herself, "was the world this cruel?" Of course, the world never answered her question, as the world itself refuses to give us an answer for why, because it doesn't feel like it needs to give that answer. It was then that, faced with the torment and anguish of the modern civilization, that Kara ran away from her home at the ripe age of 9 years old. Even so, the world outside hers, the wilderness, was just as cruel. She found herself running deeper and deeper into a dark cavern, running away from wolves. At some point, though, she was running from empty air, as not even wolves would chase their prey that far into that cave.</p>
      <p>And that was for good reason.</p>
      <p>Kara couldn't see a thing in the cave she had found herself unwillingly going into. No amount of time would let her eyes adjust to this darkness. So she stumbled around, hitting rock here, hitting stone there. After she was covered in scratches from consistently hitting sharp stones, a light finally showed itself in the darkness. A dark brown, amber light, that lit up the part of the caverns that the mechanical eye it belonged to lay, attached to it's unmoving metalic body. Kara showed no fear, though. She had no idea what the potential dangers of a giant robot 10 times the size of her was. She was just 9 years old, after all. A child, even after realizing the state of the world, still doesn't know that much, and that was evident as she lay by the robot, the warmth of the light slowly drifting her off to sleep.</p>
      <p>The next morning, she awoke, laying in the giant palm of the mechanical giant, the warm amber eye staring straight at her. And a voice erupted from it, as monotonous as a robot's could be.</p>
      <p>"<code>Unidentified person scanned. Please provide your name for completion of database entry.</code>"</p>
    <h2>Story 2.</h2>
      <p>"I'm. . . Kara. . .", she told the mechanical giant, either in fear, or in awe, "what. . . who. . . are you-?"</p>
      <p>"<code>Database entry complete. Request verifying. Request granted. I am Walker E-Mk2. The robot made to wander the world.</code>"</p>
      <p>"W-Why are you stuck here in a cave, then- If- If you're supposed to be wandering the world-?"</p>
      <p>"<code>Status: Almost all motors have been damaged. Only brain and speech module are currently in functioning state. Moving at this time would result in a 89.72% chance of permanent irreversible damage. In need of repairs.</code>"</p>
      <p>Kara looked at the broken giant with sadness in her eyes. It was broken, and it wanted to be fixed. She wished she could do something, and so, she asked, even though she knew nothing about how a robot, nonetheless this giant ten times the size of her, works, "Can I, by chance, repair you-?"</p>
      <p>And despite the doubts, the robot spoke and verified her request, "<code>Kara may repair me. I will guide Kara through the proccess.</code>"</p>
      <p>So Kara did. Kara listened to everything the robot said, and with the food in her bag helping her stay alive throughout the time, the mechanical giant soon lifted itself up once again, and brought itself and Kara out of that cavern, to see the world, just as it's primary function intended. Kara had no problem with this. After all, she had run away as well. Now, a new chapter of her story was beginning, one she was sure to enjoy, one away from the world she wanted to run away from.</p>
