		<h1>Pudding.</h1>
		<p>Pudding is the first thing that came to mind for things I could flim myself doing, so I decided to do it. It's pretty simple to do as well, considering that the instructions given basically boil down to:</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Mix Powder and Milk.<br><ul><li>Per every packet being used, add 3 cups of milk. It's a lot of milk.</li></ul></li>
			<li>Cook the Pudding.<br><ul><li>Do this at medium heat.</li><li>Consistently stir.</li><li>When the pudding starts acting like pudding, it's done, shove it into the fridge.</li></ul></li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>So, as you can expect, I made pudding. My experience making the pudding was. . . moderate, at best. I've made it plenty times before.</p>
		<p>In the end, I ended up being more worried about a different topic. Actually getting the video on here. Can you guess what I had to do to get it on here?</p>
		<p>To be honest I kinda just compressed the file size a bunch until it fit. Which kinda obliterated the quality of the video. But, it works. I suppose.</p>
		
		<h2>The Actual Pudding</h2>
		<p>So, in the end, you may be wondering, how did the pudding taste? Was it great? Wonderful? Did the mysterious happening of the creator having bias towards their own creation show itself once again?</p>
		<p>No, actually. It kinda just tasted like chocolate pudding. </p>
